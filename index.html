  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>'s mission
  is to help scientists and engineers get more research done in less
  time and with less pain by teaching them basic lab skills for
  scientific computing.  This hands-on workshop will cover basic
  concepts and tools, including program design, version control,
  and task automation.  Participants will be encouraged to
  help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own
  research problems. After this workshop, students will be able to effectively
  use UNIX systems, access and utilize supercomputing resources, and write basic
  programs for use in their research.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://hpcvl.org">HPCVL</a>is a consortium of four universities led
  by Queen's University, and includes Carleton University, University of Ottawa,
   and the Royal Military College of Canada. We specialize in secure, advanced
   computing resources and support for academic and medical clients. HPCVL
   operates a high performance data centre as part of the
   <a href="https://www.computecanada.ca/">Compute Canada</a> family.

  ETHERPAD

  At `_misc/etherpad.txt` you will find a template for the etherpad.

  Display the Etherpad for the workshop.  You can set this up in
  advance or on the first day; either way, make sure you push changes
  to GitHub after you have its URL.  To create an Etherpad, go to

      http://pad.software-carpentry.org/YYYY-MM-DD-site

  where 'YYYY-MM-DD-site' is the identifier for your workshop,
  e.g., '2015-06-10-esu'.

  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.

  SETUP

  Delete irrelevant sections from the setup instructions.  Each
  section is inside a 'div' without any classes to make the beginning
  and end easier to find.

  This is the other place where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>
  To participate in this Software Carpentry workshop, you will need an
  ssh client to log into the cluster nodes that we provide. In
  addition, you will need an up-to-date web browser.
</p>
<p>
  We maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation
  as a reference for instructors that may be useful on the
  <a href = "https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions">Configuration Problems and Solutions wiki page</a>.
</p>

<div id="shell"> <!-- Start of 'shell' section. -->
  <h3>SSH access to cluster nodes</h3>

  <p>
    SSH is a Secure Shell protocol that encrytps all data streams. It is available on almost any platform.
  </p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="shell-windows">Windows</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Download the <a href="http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html">MobaXterm SSH client</a> for Windows.</li>
        <li>Run the installer and follow the instructions.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This will provide you with an ssh command prompt. You can now connect following the instructions below.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="shell-macosx">Mac OS X</h4>
      <p>
        The default shell in all versions of Mac OS X is Bash, so no
        need to install anything.  You access Bash from the Terminal
        (found in
        <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>). You may want to keep
        Terminal in your dock for this workshop.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="shell-linux">Linux</h4>
      <p>
        The default shell is usually Bash, but if your
        machine is set up differently you can run it by opening a
        terminal and typing <code>bash</code>.  There is no need to
        install anything.

  <h3>Git</h3>

  <p>
    Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
    to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
    version of your code
    on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. Ever wanted to make backups
    of your files? Git allows you to effectively maintain every version of every
    file in a project. You will need a
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/">supported</a>
    web browser to access GitHub (current versions of Chrome, Firefox or Safari,
    or Internet Explorer version 9 or above).

    You do not have to do any setup for using Git, as it is installed
    on the systems we will work on. If you wish, you can
    <a href="https://git-scm.com/">install Git</a> on your personal computer as well.
  </p>

</div> <!-- End of 'Git' section. -->

<div id="editor"> <!-- Start of 'editor' section. -->
  <h3>Text Editor</h3>

  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words.  You do not have to install a text editor, as it
    is installed on the systems we will work on.
  </p>

<div id="python"> <!-- Start of 'Python' section. Remove the third paragraph if
           the workshop will teach Python using something other than
           the IPython notebook.

  <h3>Python</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is a popular language for
    scientific computing, and great for general-purpose programming as
    well.  Installing all of its scientific packages individually can be
    a bit difficult, so we recommend
    <a href="https://www.continuum.io/anaconda">Anaconda</a>,
    an all-in-one installer.
  </p>

</div> <!-- End of 'Python' section. -->

<div id="r"> <!-- Start of 'R' section. -->
  <h3>R</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a> is a programming language
    that is especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and
    statistical analysis. To interact with R, we will use RStudio.
  </p>
  <p>
    To install R, you will need to install the
    <a href="http://cran.utstat.utoronto.ca/">base R distribution</a> as well as
    the <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/">RStudio Release Preview</a>.
    We recommend using the RStudio Release Preview over the normal version, as
    it provides several extra coding tools that are super helpful (like the
    ability to automatically check for errors in your code). Windows users should
    install <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/">RTools</a>
    as well, as that is required for building packages on that OS.
